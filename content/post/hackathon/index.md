BIDS’ [TextXD 2020](https://bids.berkeley.edu/events/textxd-2020) conference on December 10-12 will feature an all-new, 48-hour TextXD ‘Law & Society’ Hackathon event starting at 10:00 AM on Thursday, December 10. The deadline to [apply for the TextXD Hackathon has been extended to December 5](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScs-HArdvW4uwGT3mSl_j06LEWSF7zb85TEzVoTHBgfxakfJw/viewform?mc_cid=d85ef03802&mc_eid=3be528eb15). 
 
Hackathon participants will focus on a unique collection of recent datasets that focus on police misconduct and associated public policy issues in California.  Read more here: [TextXD ‘Law & Society’ Hackathon to focus on police misconduct and data analysis in support of public policy](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/textxd-law-and-society-hackathon-focus-police-misconduct-and-data-analysis-support-public).
 
This event will bring together an interdisciplinary group of practitioners, researchers, learners, and entrepreneurs who work with text as a primary source of data. The goal of the hackathon is to help participants build responsible data-driven policy narratives that enable greater accountability, and to learn how to build representative models that reveal these narratives to a wide audience. Ultimately, this Hackathon will be a catalyst for developing and cultivating a community around a responsibly curated and publicly-available dataset, which will be released on GitLab after the event.
 
Participants will be organized into teams, whose final presentations will be evaluated using the following criteria:

* **Quality/Clarity**: Clear Descriptions of Datasets used and of analysis implemented
* **Innovation**: Innovative use of various analysis tool & methods
* **Ethics**: Ethical Use of the Data, implementation analysis 
* **Impact**: Compelling application or policy question addressed or recommendation
* **Communication**: Overall Quality of the Presentation
 
The event will conclude with team presentations and an awards ceremony on Saturday, December 12 (at 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM), featuring a panel of distinguished judges including: [Janet Napolitano](https://gspp.berkeley.edu/directories/faculty/janet-napolitano), Professor of Public Policy at Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy, former president of the University of California and former Secretary of Homeland Security under President Obama; and [David Barstow](https://journalism.berkeley.edu/person/david-barstow/), head of investigative reporting at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, 4-time Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, and a former senior writer at *The New York Times*.
