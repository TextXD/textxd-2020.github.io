TextXD brings together researchers from across a wide range of disciplines, who work with text as a primary source of data. We work to identify common principles, algorithms and tools to advance text-intensive research, and break down the boundaries between domains, to foster exchange and new collaborations among like-minded researchers. We encourage scholars and practitioners from a broad disciplinary and geographic range to apply. <font color = "blue">Talks</font> will range from the theory of text analysis and deep learning to applied analyses or new software packages. 

<font color="blue">SCHEDULE IN BRIEF</font> :
<ul>
<li>Thursday, Dec. 10th:	Invited speakers, Pannel, research talks, optional networking </li>
<li>Friday, Dec. 11th:		Invited speakers, Pannel, research talks, optional networking</li>
</ul>

We understand that some of the best work on text analysis across domains is still in development. For this reason, we wish to encourage you to share your work with us by submitting a short 3-5 minute lightning talk of your research involving text analysis.

üóìÔ∏è We will accept submissions up until November 1, 2020.
